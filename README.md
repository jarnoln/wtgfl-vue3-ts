The last one is the most difficult one since it needs to be answered every
day and often you don't want to have the same answer every day.

It is especially difficult if you are in a group of people trying to decide
together where to have lunch and everyone has their own preferences.

As it seems to be fashionable nowadays to solve life's problems with apps,
here is one to solve this particular problem (though I suppose it would be
possible to use this to solve also any other issue where a group of people
need to make some common decision).

Everyone gets to list their preferences and this will magically(*) pick the
one that is most fair for everyone.

(*) _Actually it is using one of several supported election methods. The method
can be changed from settings._

## Here is how it works:

* Pick your favorite option by clicking available choices in order of preference
* If your favorite is among availabe choices, you can add manually
* You can keep adding and changing your list until you are happy with and press "Cast vote"
* Then others will make their own lists and cast their votes
* After everyone has casted their vote, they are counted and winner is
  declared (or winners in case of tie and there is no tie-breaker)

## Supported election methods

* [Plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting)
* [Approval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting)
* [Schulze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method)
